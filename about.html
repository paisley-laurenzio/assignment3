        <p>Yummy Yums was established in 2000 by Ella and Simon Starlin. Having just had their first child, the Starlins were having trouble finding baby food products that were organic with no added colour or preservatives.  The Starilns believed that what they fed their baby would affect her health and so Ella began making her own baby food with the fruits and vegetables she grew in her garden. They began selling their organic products to their friends, also with young children, and they realized that there was a large market for what they offered and decided to create what is now, Yummy Yums.</p>
    
        <h2>Vision</h2>

        <p>Yummy Yums still lives by the principles that were the basis of the Starlin’s reason for starting this company.  We believe that natural organic foods are a much healthier choice and thus should be what everyone is feeding their children. Our vision is to see organic foods become more popular and the use of chemicals and pesticides reduced. We want to support local organic farmers and raise a healthier future.</p>
    
        <h2>Quality</h2>

        <p>At Yummy Yums we pride ourselves in the quality or our products; every fruit vegetable and meat product has been grown or fed entirely organically. All the produce and meats are cleaned thoroughly and prepared to perfection by our gourmet chefs. A board of tasters must approve each new flavor until it is perfected and ready to sell. Every ingredient, including spices used for flavoring, is also organic to ensure that Yummy Yums organic policy is accurate.</p>
